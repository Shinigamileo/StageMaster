ROOT/neutrality

DIRECTORIES :

 .
 └── results	: results for this part

FILES :

- neutrality.c		: performs a neutrality test for the given
			  key and IV models.

- neutralihash.py	: reduce the result files'names so it can be accepted
			  by my computer. No joke.

- neutralipress.py	: reduce the size of result files

- neutralisee.py	: give a better view of the results in the given file

Note	: the files'names are all "hashed" through neutralihash.py.
	  to display them, you can use the ls function written in the result
	  directory.
	  This should display the name as follow :
	  <IV model>_<key model>_<rounds>.kw
